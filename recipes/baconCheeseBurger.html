    <h1>Bacon n' Avo Cheese Burger</h1>
    <img src="../images/burger.jpg" alt="homemade bacon and avocado cheese burger">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There’s something irresistible about the combination of smoky bacon, creamy avocado, and golden, bubbling cheese
        melting over a perfectly grilled beef patty. The crispy saltiness of the bacon balances the buttery smoothness
        of ripe avocado, while the cheese ties it all together into a rich, indulgent bite. All of it is cradled in a
        soft, lightly toasted bun that soaks up the flavor without falling apart.
        This Bacon & Avo Cheeseburger isn’t just a meal — it’s a moment. Whether you’re firing up the grill for a
        weekend braai or treating yourself after a long day, it delivers the perfect mix of comfort and decadence. Every
        mouthful is juicy, messy, and satisfying in the best possible way.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="steps">Preheat your oven to 200 C and a grill to 200 C</li>
        <li class="steps">Prepare a pan by lining it with parchment paper and set it aside.</li>
        <li class="steps">Grab a large bowl. In it, mix the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, paprika,
            salt, and black pepper</li>
        <li class="steps">Grab n handful of the mixture and shape it into a patty roughly 1.5cm thick and the same
            diameter as your buns.</li>
        <li class="steps">Move the patties to the prepared baking sheet. Cover them with plastic wrap and freeze for 30
            minutes before grilling.</li>
        <li class="steps">Line your bacon slices on a wire rack and bake for 10 min, flip and bake for 5 more.</li>
        <li class="steps">In a large bowl, mix the garlic, lime juice, and salt. Halve the ripe avocados, scoop them
            out, and place them into the same bowl.</li>
        <li class="steps">Use a fork or potato masher to mash the avocados until they reach your desired level of
            creaminess. Taste the mixture and add seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li class="steps">Place the ground beef on the grill for 4-5 minutes. Then, flip the patties and cook for
            another four minutes, or until the center of each registers your desired temperature.</li>
        <li class="steps">Once the patties are cooked, move them away from direct heat and place a slice of cheese on
            each. Let the residual heat melt the cheese for about 45–60 seconds. Transfer the patties to a plate, cover
            loosely with aluminum foil, and let them rest for five minutes. While the burgers are resting, you can
            lightly toast the buns on the grill for 1–2 minutes.</li>
        <li class="steps">Assemble and enjoy!! Remember your lettuce and Tomatoes and serve with fries</li>
