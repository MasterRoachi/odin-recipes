    <h1>Pancakes</h1>
    <img src="../images/pancakes.jpg" alt="homemade pancakes">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Golden, fluffy, and impossibly light — pancakes are the ultimate breakfast classic. Whether stacked high or
        served simply with a drizzle of syrup, each bite is soft and airy with just the right touch of sweetness. The
        edges have a delicate crisp, while the center melts in your mouth, making them just as perfect for lazy weekend
        mornings as they are for quick weekday treats.

        Dress them up with fresh berries and whipped cream, go indulgent with chocolate chips and caramel sauce, or keep
        it traditional with a pat of butter and a generous pour of maple syrup. However you serve them, pancakes are a
        warm invitation to slow down, savor the moment, and start the day right.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="ingredient">1 ½ Cups (195g) All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 Tbsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 ¼ Cups (295ml) Milk</li>
        <li class="ingredient">1 Large Egg</li>
        <li class="ingredient">5 Tbsp (70g) Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li class="ingredient">2 Tbsp Sugar</li>
        <li class="ingredient">2 Tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="steps">Melt the butter in a small saucepan or microwave, then set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li class="steps">In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well
            combined.</li>
        <li class="steps">In a separate bowl, beat the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until smooth. A few
            small bits of solidified butter are fine.</li>
        <li class="steps">Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and gently whisk until just blended. The batter
            should be thick and slightly lumpy. If it’s too thick, stir in a splash of milk. Let it rest briefly so
            bubbles can form.</li>
        <li class="steps">Preheat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Test readiness by sprinkling a few drops of
            water on the surface — they should sizzle and evaporate quickly.</li>
        <li class="steps">Lightly brush the hot surface with melted butter for crisp edges (optional if using nonstick).
            Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake and spread into a 4-inch round.</li>
        <li class="steps">Cook for 1–2 minutes, until the edges look set and bubbles pop on the surface. Flip and cook
            for another 1–2 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Serve warm with syrup, extra butter, and your
            favorite toppings.</li>
